# Spieker_Pool_Calendar

I like to go lap swim at Spieker Pool. Instead of taking the 2 seconds out of my day to just look it up, I want to try to instead . try to extract data from the lap swim website itself and then that will automatically make a Google Calendar event. This way I don't have to look it up and its easier to decide which days to go lap swimming. This is pure laziness.
